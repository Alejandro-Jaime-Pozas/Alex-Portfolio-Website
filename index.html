            <p>So my full name is Alejandro Jaime Pozas but you can call me Alex. I'll share a few of my experiences and photos on this site. 
                I lived and grew up in Mexico, but I've lived in other places like London, Austin, and San Diego. I like to travel a lot and
                get out of my comfort zone every once in a while. I went to school most of my childhood in Mexico before moving to London after
                high school to learn music. I wanted to see if the musician's career was something that excited me. <p>I then decided to move back 
                to Mexico to start college, then transferred to the University of San Diego, where I studied Finance for 2 years before
                graduating.</p><p>I worked for 2 years in Austin for a real estate company, then came back to Mexico to pursue a startup that
                would help people reduce their commute and separate their work from their home with a convenient office 5mins from home.</p><p>That didn't 
                pan out, and I've always been curious about programming, so here I am, building this website, learning some python, HTML, CSSâ€‹
                along the way and hopefully become a full stack programmer!</p>

                <strong>Music (lots), Tennis, Videogames, Reading</strong>
                <p>I'm self-taught on piano, drums, and guitar. When I was a young 5 year old kid, I had an experience unlike any other. 
                    I'll never forget it; I was on a trip with my family and we met some relatives and went waterskiing along with some other
                    activities. Then, a father and son both started playing drums in their music room...I fell in love with the sound and 
                    experience and have been playing since I was 9 years old. 20 full years. That was followed by the piano, then acoustic guitar,
                    and most recently the electric guitar. Not only do I play, I'm an avid collectionist, I have over 400 CD's (a now extinct
                    species) and love listening to music, with hundreds of playlists on both apple music and spotify. I'm a big audiophile, 
                    so basically love to buy the best headphones and speakers of any kind, and will some day have a top of the line music 
                    system in my future home.</p>
                <p>I love tennis, both watching it and playing it. I'm a big Roger Federer fan, and in fact have 4 of his tennis caps at home.
                    I've never really been consistent at playing, but I play about once a month, which is something I want to improve. 
                </p>
                <p>I'm a huge video game fan, mostly story driven or good open-world games. I mostly play on the ps4 and some of my favorites 
                    include God of War, Red dead Redemption, Mass Effect, and The Last of Us. I love reading as well, some favorite books are
                    <i>Thinking: Fast and Slow, Cosmos, The Hobbit, Origin Story</i> among others.

                <h1 id="vacations">My Greatest Vacation</h1>
                <strong>Iceland</strong>

                </figure>
                <p>The pictures above are from my phone! If you ever go to Iceland, I suggest you go at least 5 days and don't take the tourist suggestions. I went there with
                    my family and we made a whole loop of the island in 7 days, staying in different towns every day. Most people make
                    day trips and stay in Reykjavik but I would suggest you take the nomadic route. Summer is the time to visit, you see
                    lush landscapes of all colors, green, orange, purple, black, white ice...There's just a lot to see and everything is
                    outside, it's the ideal nature trip. We had an amazing town and visited places like Reykjavik, Mivatn, Akureyri, Hofn, Vik.
